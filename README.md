Functional 2D Game Framework in Haskell

Inspired by [CodeWorld](https://github.com/google/codeworld) and [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)

Currently a Work In Progress, but technically barely functional. The example in the app folder works, it displays an 800x800 window with the Pine logo.

Documentation is currently minimal and that is something I'm working on, as well as everything else.

### TODO:

- [x] Textures
- [ ] Events
- [ ] Sounds
- [ ] Text
- [ ] Improved/cleaner backend
- [ ] Optional higher level api with premade game state and entities
