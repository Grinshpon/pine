Functional 2D Game Framework in Haskell

Inspired by [CodeWorld](https://github.com/google/codeworld) and [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)

<br>

<br>

Currently a Work In Progress, but technically functional. Documentation is currently minimal and that is something I'm working on, as well as everything else

### TODO:

- [x] Textures
- [ ] Events
- [ ] Sounds
- [ ] Text
- [ ] Improved/cleaner backend
- [ ] Optional higher level api with premade game state and entities
